Biwako is far from finished even in the short term. It's come a long way in just a few months, but there's still a lot more to do.

biwako.bin
----------

 - Finish getting bit structures to work properly and integrate them with regular structures
 - Conditionally load different structures based on previous values
 - Support referencing previous values on substructures, not just peer fields
 - Flesh out more example formats to see what other features are missing
 - Chunks containing other chunks
 - Additional field types, including 80-bit IEEE-754 floats
 - if blocks inside of class definitions (possible? use with instead?)
 - 

biwako.csv
----------

 - Additional field types, including currency
 -
