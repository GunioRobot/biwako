 - Support referencing previous values on substructures, not just peer fields
 - Flesh out more example formats to see what other features are missing
 - Chunks containing other chunks
 - Additional field types, including 80-bit IEEE-754 floats
 - with blocks inside of class definitions to handle branching
 - Support for raw offsets, for both reading and writing
